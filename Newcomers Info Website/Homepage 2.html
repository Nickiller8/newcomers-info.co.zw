<h1>ARUNDEL NEWCOMERS STUDY PAGE</h1>

<h2>Why is newcomers important?</h2>

Newcomers is important because every Arundel girl must know the history of the school and to understand the ethics, the backstory and how to act as an Arundel lady. It is basically testing how much you know about the school, and it is important to know the prefects mentioned in the newcomers as well.

<h2>What is newcomers?</h2>

<p>
Newcomers is a test given to all form 1s/newcomers at the school to test their knowledge on how much they know about the school, it is a test written as a surprise scheduled by the prefects and for this year, you must get 90% and above to pass.
