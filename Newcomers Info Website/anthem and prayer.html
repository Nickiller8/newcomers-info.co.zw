<h2>Arundel School Anthem</h2>
<h3>Words from Romans 12</h3>
<h3> Music by John Hodgson</h3>
<b>All:</b>
<br>Therefore I implore you by God's mercy
<br>To offer your veryselves to him
<br>A living sacrifice,
<br>Dedicated and fit for His acceptance.
<br>The worship offered by mind and heart.
<br>Then you will beable to discern the will of God,
<br>and to know what is good,
<br>Acceptable, and perfect.</br>
<b>Choir</b>
<br>Love in all sincerity,
<br>Loathing evil, and clinging to the good.
<br>Let love for the brotherhood breed
<br>warmth of mutual affection.
<br>Give pride of place to one another
<br>in esteem</br>
<b>All:</b>
<br>Let hope keep you joyful:
<br>In trouble stand firm;
<br>Persist in prayer.
<br>Have equal regard for one another
<br>Do not let evil conquer you,
<br>But use good to defeat evil.</br>
<h2>School Prayer</h2>
<p>O Lord, our heavenly father, from whom comes every good and perfect gift we beseech You to bestow Your blessing on our School. Give all who work here the true love of knowledge which makes all study a discovery and a joy. May the spirit of loyalty and devotion bind us all more closely together tha, that we may labour not for our own advantage but for the common good. May Your wisdom guide and prosper our work and games, that we may grow in the love of all that is true and honest and of good report. And when we go out in the world, may we carry with us the ideal and the power of the service which You give us in Your Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. <b><em>Amen</em></b></p>
