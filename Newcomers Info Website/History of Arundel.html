<h1>History of Arundel</h1>
<section>
<h2>Foundation</h2>
<p>Arundel School was conceived in <strong>1950</strong> and founded in <strong>1955</strong> to cater for both day girls and boarders, and would be interdenominational, drawing pupils from all corners of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (now known as Zimbabwe, Zambia and Malawi). </p>
<p>The site originally formed part of Arundel farm owned by Mr T Simpson and it covers an area of 100 acres. The foundation stone was laid on the 27th of May 1955 in the front hall (reception) by Lord Malvern. The first chairman of the board was Lt Commander Norman Hughes, and the first Headmistress was Miss Alisa Nicole Smith. The current Chairman of the board is Mr Douglas Hoto.</p>

<h2>The Boarding Houses</h2>
<p>The first boarding house, Sabi, was ready for the first intake of girls in January 1956. It was named after the Sabi (Save) River in Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe). The school opened with everything from lessons to boarding staff offices situated in Sabi house, only to be moved early in the First Term to the newly completed classroom block. Art lessons, however, continued to be taught in the Sabi attic. </p>
<p>The original boarding house, Sabi, was used for lessons, boarding and staff offices up until 1959, when extensions to the school were completed: the ground floor consisting of two classrooms and the upper floor (now known as the Cinema) becoming a temporary Chapel. Kafue House was completed in 1957 and Shire House in 1958. The foundation stones for the present-day Chapel were laid in 1971 and Angwa House was built in 1984.</p>

<h2>Donations</h2>
<p>The Virtue Bell (situated in the quad) was donated by Mrs Thorne in memory of her husband who served on the ship H.M.S Virtue during World War 2 in 1943. The Campanile, dedicated in memory of GRA Johnson’s ‘Audacious Annue Coeptis’ (look with favour upon a bold beginning), houses the Chapel Bell. Also in the Chapel grounds is a bench donated by Mrs Calderwood (Alcock) in memory of her husband Fr Peter Alcock, who served as Chaplain at Arundel during her time.</p>
<p>Fenella Cottage, in Troutbeck, Nyanga was donated by Mr Simpson, it was built in 1991 as a retreat for staff.</p> 
<p>Later additions to the school include the Val Barbour Squash courts, the Sixth Form Science Laboratories, the Bell Tower, the Twiss Pavilion (named after the longest serving headmistress, Dorothy Twiss, who served from 1969-1988), the Art Block and the Richards Computer Centre (named after the first Headmaster of Arundel, Mr Wally Richards). The Kewada Hall was built on the site of the gymnasium and named after Mr Ramesh and Mrs Ila Kewada, who were parents, board members and significant donors.</p>
