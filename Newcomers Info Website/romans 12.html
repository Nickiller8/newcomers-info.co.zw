<h2>Romans 12 <br>King James Version(KJV)</h2>
<p>I beseech you before, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not confirmed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.</p>
<p>For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, acording as God hath to every man the measure of faith. For as we have many memebrs in one body, and all members have not the same office: So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one or another. Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith; Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching; Or he that exhorteth, on exhortion: he that given, let him do it with simplicity: he that ruleth, with diligence; he that showeth mercy, with cheerfulness. </p>
<p>Let love be without dissumulation. Abhor that which is evil: cleave to that which is good. Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another; Not slothful in business; continuing instant in prayer; Distributing to the necessary of saints; given to hospitality. </p>
<p>Bless them which persecute you: bless and curse not. Rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that weep. Be of the smae mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condensed to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits. Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men. If it be possible, aas much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men. </p>
<p>Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengaence is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.</p>
<p><em>"Thefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head."</em></p>
<p> Be no overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.</p>
